h1. ActiveRecord Skeleton

A basic skeleton for ActiveRecord-backed Ruby apps

h2. Features

* YAML database config
* Rake tasks for generating migrations and migrating the database
* Reasonable, Rails-style directory structure
* Ready to go with SQLite 3
* RACK_ENV-aware and thus ready to use with multiple environments with Sinatra or any other Rack-backed webapp framework

h2. Usage

# Get "tarball":http://github.com/colszowka/activerecord-skeleton/tarball/master
# Extract tarball to desired folder
# Create a migration with <code>rake generate:migration NAME=create_users</code>
# Create a model in lib/user.rb: <code>class User < ActiveRecord::Base; end;</code>
# Add application code in project root directory and <code>require 'init'</code> in it
